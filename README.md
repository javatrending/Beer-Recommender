# Beer Recommender App

## Try This Beer!

With so many different beers on the market, trying to choose a new beer to try seems to be based on a whimsical name and eye-catching label. But with our help, we can tell you what beers to tyr based on similar tastes of users like you.

After entering one to three of your favorite beers, the app runs your choices through our model and returns a list of new beers to try.
